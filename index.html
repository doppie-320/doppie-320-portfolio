            <h1>One of my hobbies: 3D Modelling // MEET PHOEBE</h1>
            <p>Meet <span style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bolder;">PHOEBE REA H. SATURNS</span>, a first-year college student interested in the world of astrophysics!
                I don't have much of a story for her, or much of a use of her model, but I hope I get into 3d modelling and arts more!
            <br>
            <br>
            She is a little passion project of mine as I learn the ins-and-outs of character creation in the Blender3d workflow and ecosystem.

            <h1>ONE OF MY HOBBIES: FLIGHT SIMULATION NERD</h1>
            <p>Since 8th grade, flight simulation as a pastime and a video-game piqued my interest,
                and now, for the past half-decade, I've immersed myself in the world of flight simulation and aviation, connecting with aviation students, maintenance engineers, pilots all over the Philippines.
                <br><br>
                Now, some day after I graduate college, I too dream of taking to the skies up above.
